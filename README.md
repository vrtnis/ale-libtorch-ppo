# ALE-libtorch-PPO

<p align="center"><a href="https://youtu.be/MQsjzNbIrsQ"><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8b027b6-2294-4142-8fad-549f830d48a3" width="400"></a></p>

This project is a C++ application designed to train an agent to master Atari games, with a specific focus on the classic game "Breakout". It leverages reinforcement learning, implementing the Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) algorithm to enable the agent to learn and improve its gameplay through trial and error. Multi-threading is used to achieve greater throughput for interacting with the game environment in parallel.

Built using Bazel, this project integrates `libtorch` (the C++ frontend for PyTorch) for its neural network components and the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) to interface with the Atari games. This combination provides a high-performance environment for cutting-edge AI research.

While Python-based libraries dominate the open-source RL scene by offering ease of use and a vast ecosystem, `ALE-libtorch-PPO` contributes a high-performance, C++-native alternative. It is designed for developers and researchers who need high performance, a clean C++ integration path, and a transparent, focused implementation of a strong & popular RL algorithm.

## Run Instructions
To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Install Bazel by following the [Bazel installation guide](https://bazel.build/install) for your operating system.

2. Install FFmpeg which the environment video recorder uses to generate MP4s of the agent playing the game.

3. Clone the repository:
   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/cemlyn007/ALE-libtorch-PPO.git
   cd ALE-libtorch-PPO
   ```

4. Download the ROMs:
   ```shell
   mkdir roms
   ./scripts/download_unpack_roms.sh
   ```

5. Train the agent using Bazel:
   ```shell
   bazel run //src/bin:train --compilation_mode=opt -- $(pwd)/roms/breakout.bin $(pwd)/logs/train $(pwd)/videos/train train $(pwd)/configs/v0.yaml
   ```
   Or alternatively, with VS Code, you can run the tasks. The command line arguments do the following:
   1. Specify which ROM to use.
   2. Specify the directory to write TensorBoard logs to.
   3. Specify the directory to write videos to.
   4. Specify the group name used for logging parameters to TensorBoard.
   5. Specify the path to the YAML file containing the config to use for running the application.
   6. Optional: specify the location to write a libtorch profile to which can be examined using Perfetto.

6. Evaluate a checkpoint and write gameplay videos without training:
   ```shell
   bazel run //src/bin:train --compilation_mode=opt -- eval $(pwd)/roms/breakout.bin $(pwd)/checkpoints/train/latest.pt $(pwd)/videos/eval $(pwd)/configs/v0.yaml 3
   ```
   The eval mode loads the checkpoint, runs deterministic greedy-policy games,
   and writes `episode_1.mp4`, `episode_2.mp4`, etc. to the video directory.
   The final argument is optional and defaults to 3 episodes.

7. Render annotated checkpoint videos with policy/value graphs:
   ```shell
   bazel run //src/bin:train --compilation_mode=opt -- view $(pwd)/roms/breakout.bin $(pwd)/checkpoints/train/latest.pt $(pwd)/videos/view $(pwd)/configs/v0.yaml 3
   ```
   View mode writes the same episode files, but each frame includes a side
   panel with the critic state value `V(s)`, policy probabilities for the
   available actions, selected action, step count, and episode return. Since
   this is a PPO actor-critic model, the action bars show policy probabilities
   rather than Q-values.

## Checkpointing

Checkpointing is configured in the YAML config file. By default it is disabled:

```yaml
checkpoint_dir: ""
checkpoint_every: 0
resume_checkpoint: ""
```

To save checkpoints every 100 rollouts, set:

```yaml
checkpoint_dir: "checkpoints/train"
checkpoint_every: 100
resume_checkpoint: ""
```

The trainer writes numbered checkpoints such as
`checkpoint_rollout_00000100.pt` and also updates `latest.pt` in the same
directory. To resume training, point `resume_checkpoint` at a saved file:

```yaml
checkpoint_dir: "checkpoints/train"
checkpoint_every: 100
resume_checkpoint: "checkpoints/train/latest.pt"
```

Checkpoints include the model, optimizer state, next rollout index, and basic
architecture metadata. They do not include live ALE emulator state, so resumed
runs restore training state but create fresh emulator instances.
  
## Results
Evaluated using the following hardware:
* ASUS ROG STRIX X670E-F GAMING WIFI
* AMD Ryzen™ 9 7950X3D × 32
* NVIDIA GeForce RTX™ 4090

### V0 Config
<p align="center"><img width="400" alt="TensorBoard showing PPO achieving score of 400 on Breakout within 10 million agent steps." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1b62320-87e8-4ea9-9dd7-dbed2d0dfe98" /></p>
Achieved 10 million agent steps in 37 minutes and 39 seconds, using the v0 config, with an average steps per second of ~4426 with video recording enabled as well.

### V1 Config
<p align="center"><img width="400" alt="TensorBoard showing PPO achieving the maximum score on Breakout of 864." src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1bcec5b-20a2-49f6-ad9a-387f81950cff" /></p>
Achieved an average of ~26,289 steps per second, with video recording enabled, with hardware still not fully utilised.

## Profiling
There are three views for profiling this application, using `./scripts/flamegraph.sh`, running the application with a 6th command line argument which specifies where to save the Perfetto profile, lastly you can use nsys to profile the application. The flamegraph script will generate a flamegraph of the application, which can be viewed in a web browser. The Perfetto profile can be opened in the Perfetto UI, and NVIDIA Nsight Systems UI can also be used for profiling if you hook up the path to the `train` binary.
